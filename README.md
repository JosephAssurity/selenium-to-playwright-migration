# Selenium to Playwright Migration Demo

This project demonstrates a phased migration strategy from a legacy Selenium BDD automation framework to Playwright while preserving Gherkin feature files.

## Goals

- Reuse existing BDD feature files
- Demonstrate Selenium vs Playwright execution
- Show a scalable migration approach
- Reduce flakiness and improve execution speed
- Provide migration tooling (step generator)

## Structure

- features/ → Shared Gherkin feature files
- selenium-legacy/ → Baseline Selenium BDD implementation
- playwright-migrated/ → Migrated Playwright BDD implementation
- tools/ → Migration helper scripts
- docs/ → Migration strategy and design notes

Work in progress.
